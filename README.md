Hello! I'm Lynnura, Also known as Nura. Welcome to my github! 

A little bit about me:

I study Media and Communications and planing to go further into game design and development in the future. 
I love making stories that make people feel something, be it happy or sad or something inbetween, I think games is a great media to tell theese stories in. I am more or less self-taught but wish to get an education in the field.

- My pronouns are She/her but i don't mind They/them
- I am currently learning and using C#

Current project is a 2d story game about finding oneself.
